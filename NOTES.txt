problem:
- nest does not record weights, stimulus, neuronal parameters, only recording devices 
- data in diff files for each recording device
- data stored as ascii text, inefficient
- no related metadata is stored


current way to store:
- format is binary, not documented - hard to understand later
- simulation results are stored in separate files, even split in chunks
- simulation profile is stored separately


- nest recommends to use Python class layer for managing parameters, model variations and resulting datasets (chapter 8)

- spike detector can have a label

NEST Persistence: an implementation of the interface that operates with nest 
functions to build objects for later serialization / deserialization
    IAFNeuron(INode): __init__(nest_id)
    NestConnection(IConnection): __init__(source_ids, target_ids) ...
    Multimeter(IDevice): __init__(nest_id) ...
    SpikeDetector(IDevice): __init__(nest_id) ...
    WeightMatrix(IWeights): __init__(??) ...


an interface that knows how to serialize an object
    INode
        name()          -> id as string
        properties()    -> dict (?)

    IConnection
        name()          -> id as string
        source()        -> INode? with NIX source_id
        target()        -> INode? with NIX source_id
        properties()    -> dict (?)

    ISignal
        name()          -> id as string
        source()        -> INode? with NIX source_id
        times()
        unit()
        values()
        unit()

    ISpikeTrain
        name()          -> id as string
        source()        -> INode? with NIX source_id
        events()
        unit()

    IWeights
        ...


    # ----------------------------------
    IDevice
        name()          -> id as string
        observable()
        senders()
        times()
        values()        -> what if many recordables?



a NestBlock that takes objects that implements an interface and
serializes / deserializes it

    all nix functions like searching etc.
    so inherit? from nix::Block
    do NOT inherit!!

    # these are static factory methods of nix4nest classes:

    create_node(name, type, params) # neurons, stimulators, recorders
    create_connection(source_name, target_name, params)
    create_signal(source_name, times, values)
    create_spiketrain(source_name, times)
    create_weights(sources, targets, times, weights) ?? append

    # these are implemented inside block:

    block::nodes()
    block::connections()
    block::signals()
    block::spiketrains()
    block::weights()

    # these methods are implemented in NestFactory and exposed via Block:

    dump_node(nest_id) -> nix::Node
    dump_connection(source_id, target_id) -> nix::Connection
    dump_multimeter(nest_id, recordable) -> nix::Signal
    dump_spike_detector(nest_id) -> [nix::SpikeTrain, ...]



Override (or monkey patch?) Nix File create_block and blocks to create 
proper NestBlocks
